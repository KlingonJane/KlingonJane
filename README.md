- 👋 Hi, I’m @KlingonJane
- 👀 I’m interested in dogs, prime numbers, backgammon, clocks/watches, flashlights and Star Trek.
- Oh yes! Also observational mountain climbing.  No, I don't do it myself.  I observe from a great distance to laugh at them from the comfort of my fireplace.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning git and github
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Sensor Watch Lite project by JoeyCastillo
- 📫 How to reach me: hmmm, I guess ralphmschumacher@gmail.com
